# CV Parsing SaaS

## Overview

**CV Parsing SaaS** is a two-part project:

- **resume-parser**: A Python Flask backend that provides a REST API for parsing resumes/CVs. It supports file uploads, extracts structured data (JSON), and offers integration-ready endpoints for use in your own applications or ATS.
- **seller-website**: A modern, responsive landing page and documentation site built with Flask and Jinja2 templates. It showcases the service, provides API documentation, and offers integration guides for frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, and Next.js.

> **Note:** Up to this point, I used AI tools to iterate quickly and efficiently on the initial landing page and project structure. This allowed for rapid prototyping and refinement of the user experience and documentation.
